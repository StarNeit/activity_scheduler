### Implementation
1. What libraries did you use? What are they used for? Why did you choose them
specifically?
```text
I used React according to task requirement.
And some additional libraries are used as follows.

Styling: @material-tailwind/react
I chosen this because it makes develop easy to develop beautiful UI by using tailwindcss and components from material ui.

Store management: zustand
There are many libraries for store management such as redux, mobx and zustand etc.
Zustand is the best option for small app and it's easy to understand and use.
So I chosen zustand for store management.

Form validation: react-hook-form
I chosen this library for handling form because it's flexible and extensible with easy-to-use validation.

API: axios
For fetching data from weather service, I used this library.

```text
For displaying weather, user can either point the location he wants on google map or enter latitude and longitude through input.

In handling schedules, there should be status which shows schedule is completed or not.
And user can change status (completed, pending etc) by status dropdown in schedule card directly without opening form modal.
